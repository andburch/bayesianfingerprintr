The goal of bayespackage is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of bayespackage from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("andburch/fingerprint-mixture-model")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval=F}
library(bayespackage)

fake.data <- 
  data.frame(
  mrb = c(rgamma(50,64,160), rgamma(50,2500,5000)),
  location = sample(c("palace", "domestic"), 100, replace = T)
  )

output <- run_model(fake.data, "2sex.2age", 15000, 5, F, F, 3, F)

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
